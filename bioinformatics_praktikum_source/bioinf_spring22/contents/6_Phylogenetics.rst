Phylogenetics
=============

General information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Main objective
--------------

Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding the evolutionary history, ecology and diversity of life on earth. In this lecture we will introduce basic concepts of phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences. We will show you how to infer the evolutionary relationship of groups of organisms. To this end, we will collect phylogenetically informative sequences and introduce to you step-by-step how to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree via a web-based interface. We will also practice how generate phylogenetic trees using software on the command line.

Learning objectives
-------------------

Students are able to collect phylogenetically informative sequences from a group of organisms of interest and prepare them in an adequate format. They can explain the different steps and know examples of software required to generate a phylogenetic tree. Using phylogenetic trees, they can explain the hypothesised evolutionary relationship between organisms. 


Requirements
------------

Laptop with access to the ETHZ network, via VPN if necessary.

Generating a phylogenetic tree (via a web-server)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section of the course, we will introduce you to `NGPhylogeny <https://ngphylogeny.fr>`__, a web-based platform that performs a phylogenetic analysis in a user-friendly way, that is without the need for the installation of several software programmes and the re-formatting of input and output files. The user can chose to run the analyses with a "one click" workflow using default tools and parameters, or create more advanced and customised workflows. The platform provides detailed information about the individual steps that are performed and the tools that are used to execute them:

0. Collection and formatting of sequence data   
1. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
2. MSA curation
3. Tree inference
4. Tree visualisation
