The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a database hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) and  Protein Information Resource (PIR) for protein sequence, annotation and functions. Uniprot consists of three databases the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), and the UniProt Archive (UniParc).

The UniProtKB consists of two sections, a manually annotated part and an automated annotated part which awaits manual annotation. Each entry provides functional information about a protein with as much annotation information as possible.
