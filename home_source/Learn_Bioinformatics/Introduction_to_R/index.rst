Introduction to R
=================

R is a programming language for statistics. When working with large data sets, it enables the manipulation of data and creation of graphical representations.

This interactive course in workshop format introduces the basics of programming in R. Participants will follow a live demonstration of command execution on their own computers and work individually on exercises covering the topics listed in the learning goals.
