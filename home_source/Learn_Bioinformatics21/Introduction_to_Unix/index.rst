Introduction to Unix
====================

Research in biology relies increasingly on computational analyses, but state-of-the-art tools often lack a graphical user interface or web service. Use of the command line is essential for such tools, but also offers increased power and flexibility for others.

This interactive course in workshop format introduces the basics of working on the Unix command line. Participants will follow a live demonstration of command execution on their own computers and work individually on exercises covering the topics listed in the learning goals.

Learning Goals
--------------

Participants should be able to:

* Access a Unix server and use the bash interactive shell to execute commands
* Navigate and organize the file system
* Look at and search within files
* Control the input and output of commands and construct simple command chains
* Use the module system and submit jobs to a scheduling queue
