Overall Learning objectives
---------------------------
The practical course in “Bioinformatics” aims to equip undergraduate students in Biology with basic competencies in performing bioinformatic analyses. The course will introduce the use of the command line interface (UNIX/LINUX) and reinforce programming skills in python and R, building on proficiencies that were acquired during the 2nd and 3rd semester courses “Informatics” and “Statistics”. Existing knowledge will be augmented by programmatic, analytical and statistical principles as they pertain to biological data, to support concepts taught in concurrent courses, and to prepare students for the 3rd year of the study curriculum.
